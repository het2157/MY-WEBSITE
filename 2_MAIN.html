    <p>
      Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple or black maple trees. In cold climates,
      these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises
      in the sap in the spring. Trees can be tapped by boring holes into their trunks and collecting the sap. This is
      processed by heating to evaporate some of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup. Maple syrup was first collected and
      used by the Indigenous people of North America; the practice was adopted by European settlers. Quebec, Canada, is by far
      the largest producer, making about three-quarters of the world's output. The syrup is graded based on its density and
      translucency. Maple syrup is often eaten as an accompaniment to food, as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener and
      flavouring agent. Maple syrup and the sugar maple tree are symbols of Canada and several US states, in particular
      Vermont. (Full article...)
