        <p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.</p>

        <p>Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by
            the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that usually contain
            numerous links guiding readers to more information.
        </p>

        <p>Written collaboratively by volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with
            Internet access, except in limited cases in which editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
            Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting
            over a billion visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-five million articles in more
            than 300 languages, including 7,018,958 articles in English, with 108,657 active contributors in the past
            month.</p>
